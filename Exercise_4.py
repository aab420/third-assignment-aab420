In this folder you will find a subfolder with a file "Data points.txt".
- The first column of the text file provides a list of 1000 points related to sensor 1
- The second column of the text file provides a list of 1000 points related to sensor 2

Write a program that extracts data from the file and computes the average 
of the two measurements (for each row, the average between sensor 1 and sensor 2). 
You will end up with 1000 data points that you need to write in another text file called "Data points average.txt"
