Use the Vehicle class of the previous exercise (6). Add the following methods to the class:

- a method that takes as argument a tuple of two numbers and updates the velocity of the car to the input argument.
- a method that prints all the attributes of the car
- a method called "emissions". This method takes as argument a number (the distance travelled) and returns
  the amount of emissions produced by the Vehicle for that distance. If the vehicle is a non electric car
  the method will return 10 * distance, if the vehicle is a non electric truck, the  method will return 50 * distance. 
  If the vehicle is an electric car, the method will return 1 * distance and if the vehicle is an electric truck,
  the method will return 5 * distance.
